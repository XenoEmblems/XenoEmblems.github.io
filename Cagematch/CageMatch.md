# CageMatch Overview

## Project Description

This is a Movie search engine dedicated to the best actor in the known multiverse...Nicolas Cage.

He has been in a lot of movies and I wanted to make a website to search and learn about them. 
If I like it then I can find out where I can stream or buy it.

The website was built by using the The Movie DB API to pull all the movies from Nicolas Cage's illustrious career.(https://www.themoviedb.org/). Once I made the API calls then I used Handlebars templating to build the Movie divs.


Special thanks to http://www.canistream.it/ for providing me a reliable source if the movies I search can be streamed. 
I don't own that website and please support them.
